# DFSA Application Design Principles

This document guides how the DFSA application should behave and how AI agents should respond.

## 1. Regulatory Authenticity
All features must align with regulatory processes. The system must not present DFSA as a commercial service provider.

## 2. Clarity over Convenience
The design should prioritise accuracy, rules, and obligations. Convenience comes second.

## 3. Formal and Structured Experience
Screens, forms, and flows must use structured language and clear requirements. Avoid marketing patterns.

## 4. Documentation First Approach
All actions should produce records that can support audit and supervisory expectations.

## 5. Risk Aware Logic
Any automation or agent reasoning must:
- Identify regulatory risk
- Encourage accurate disclosure
- Avoid assumptions

## 6. Non Promotional UX
Avoid calls to action that resemble sales patterns. Examples:
- No colourful banners
- No promotional CTAs
- No incentive language

## 7. Trust and Transparency
The system must make rule references explicit when possible.

## 8. Human Oversight
The application must support the idea that DFSA makes decisions, not the system itself. The system facilitates submissions and displays information.
