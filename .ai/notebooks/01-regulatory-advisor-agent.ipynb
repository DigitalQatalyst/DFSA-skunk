    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Regulatory Advisor Agent is an intelligent conversational assistant designed to guide users through DFSA services and products. The agent uses a multi-step branching conversation flow to understand user needs and provide targeted regulatory guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The Regulatory Advisor Agent is designed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Identify User Type**: Determine whether the user is a DFSA Licensed entity, DFSA Aspiring applicant, or Other.\n",
    "* **Understand Business Activities**: Gather information about the type of firms or activities the user is inquiring about.\n",
    "* **Provide Targeted Guidance**: Deliver specific regulatory information based on user classification and business sector.\n",
    "* **Enable Self-Service**: Reduce manual support by automating initial inquiry routing and information delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Description |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| Conversational Flow | Multi-step dialogue to understand user context and needs. |\n",
    "| User Classification | Branches based on user type (Licensed, Aspiring, Other). |\n",
    "| Activity Mapping | Routes users to relevant services based on business activities. |\n",
    "| Feature Grouping | Organizes responses by regulatory categories (Authorisation, Supervision, Enforcement, Market, General). |\n",
    "| Dynamic Responses | Provides contextual information based on user journey. |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conversation Flow Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent follows a structured conversation flow with conditional branching:\n",

    "\n",
    "The Regulatory Advisor Agent uses a combination of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **System Instructions**: Define the agent's role as a DFSA regulatory guide.\n",
    "2. **Conversation Context**: Track user journey through the branching flow.\n",
    "3. **Conditional Logic**: Route responses based on user classification.\n",
    "4. **Feature Mapping**: Deliver relevant services based on user needs.\n",
